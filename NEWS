## 1.3.1/1.3.2/1.3.3/1.3.4

08/09 October 2014

### Enhancement

* `concat.split.compact` and `concat.split.multiple` are now
  simply wrappers for `cSplit` and no longer use 
  `:::read.concat` to split up the values.
* `concat.split.expanded` and `concat.split.list` now made
  `data.table` compatable. 

Added functions:

* `cSplit`

  Before the release of 1.4.0, the basic `concat.split*` 
  functions would become simple wrappers for `cSplit`, which
  is much more efficient than the previous implementations.
  The earlier functions will remain for compatability purposes.
  Since `cSplit` is already in use, it will be an exported
  function.

## 1.3.0

27 October 2013

### Feature Changes

* Due to changes resulting from the introduction of `numMat` and
  `charMat`, `concat.split.expanded` and `concat.split` now have 
  an additional argument, `type`, which takes a value of either
  `"numeric"` or `"character"`. It is set to a default of 
  `type = "numeric"` in the case of `concat.split.expanded` and 
  `type = NULL` in the case of `concat.split`.

Added functions:

* :::numMat

  `numMat` replaces `binaryMat` and `valueMat` for numeric data.

* :::charMat

  `charMat` replaces `charBinaryMat` for string data.

Dropped functions:

Due to changes introduced after recommendations by @flodel, 
the following functions have been rewritten as `numMat` and 
`charMat`

* :::binaryMat
* :::valueMat
* :::charBinaryMat

## 1.2.1

20 October 2013

### Feature Changes

New function added:

* :::charBinaryMat

  `concat.split.expanded` did not previously support expanding 
  "character" data. Due to prompting by @juba, `charBinaryMat` 
  has been included to handle such cases.

## 1.2.0

27 August 2013

### Enhancement

* Further refinement of `Stacked` and `merge.stack`. `merge.stack`
  is now faster than `Reshape`, at least for large datasets.

## 1.1.0

18 August 2013

### Enhancement

* `Stacked` and `merge.stack` now made MUCH faster using almost
  a pure `data.table` solution.

## 1.0.2

17 August 2013

### Bugfixes

* When `Stacked` results in a list of length 1, it is "unlisted"
  before being returned.
* `Reshape` (and as a result, `concat.split.multiple(..., 
  direction = "long")`) has been enhanced by the addition of a
  feature to automatically add an ID variable if the present 
  "IDs" are not unique.

## Feature Changes

New functions added:

* getanID
* :::Names

## 1.0.1

16 August 2013

### Bugfixes

* `read.concat` updated to use `count.fields` to determine the 
  correct number of columns that the resulting `data.frame` 
  should have.

### Feature change

* `Reshape` now has an option to remove the `rownames` from the
  output, set to `TRUE` by default.

## 1.0

12 August 2013

Initial commit of splitstacshape with the following main functions:

* concat.split (plus: concat.split.compact, concat.split.expanded, 
  concat.split.list, and concat.split.multiple) -- To split 
  concatenated data into more manageable data formats.
* Reshape -- To help base R's reshape function handle unbalanced 
  data and simplify the reshape syntax (wide to long only).
* Stacked -- To selectively stack columns of a data.frame.

### Full list of functions

*Non-exported functions are indicated with ::: before their names.*

* concat.split.compact
* concat.split.expanded
* concat.split.list
* concat.split.multiple
* concat.split
* merged.stack
* Reshape
* Stacked
* :::binaryMat
* :::FacsToChars
* :::NoSep
* :::othernames
* :::read.concat
* :::valueMat
